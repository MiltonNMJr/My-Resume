    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am excited to pursue my first programming job. With a firm grasp of
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (pending), I am eager to elevate my skills. I have
      purposely chosen not to rely on Large Language Models to enhance my
      problem-solving abilities. Leveraging 11 years of experience in airport
      operations, I have honed various soft skills that I am enthusiastic about
      bringing to a new industry.
